		<h5> Todo </h5>
		<span> I also need to secure the DB and only retrieve the current's user's data, and only allow the user to insert/remove items.
		</span>
		<span> Take care of dates, starting with converting the string dates from json files. Figure out how to split jobs, think about adding time spent, starting a job, pausing it, closing it.
		</span>
		<h5> Roadmap </h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h5> Jobs (high priority)</h5>
				<span> Limit the jobs gathered to the current week.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5> Dates (high priority)</h5>
				<span> Weekrange, past day, future day, today, what else? I should fill the DB with data from Rev on publish, like I used to with IMAFRU.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5> Stats (medium priority)</h5>
				<span> All the stats should be refreshed whenever a job/expense is added/removed/updated. Should they be stored/cached?
				</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5> Day (medium priority)</h5>
				<ul>
					<li> Name of day </li>
					<li> Formatted date </li>
					<li> Remainder for the day OR Bonus for the day </li>
					<li> Current day's wages </li>
					<li> List of jobs done </li>
					<li> Lock button, becomes unavailable as soon as and job's been entered for the day </li>
					<li> Add job input with pay and binary mood evaluation </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5> Rev parsing (low priority) </h5>
				<span> Make it easy to copy and paste the earnings page to insert work history.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5> Expenses (low priority)</h5>
				<span> Expenses can be carried over when a new week is created but don't have to. Expense bar shows current weekly wages vs current total expenses.
					There are two types of expenses, past and future (wants, gifts, rewards for self).
				</span>
			</li>
			<li> <h5> Blog (doesn't even register priority)</h5>
				<span> The blog has got to be updated, and especially taken out of the main html file. (collapsible at very least)
				</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
